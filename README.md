# Advent Of Code 2020

My goal this year is to write short, neat (not necessary nice or "correct") snippets in Java.
I try to utilize the Stream API extensively.

The whole project is written on Repl.it:
https://repl.it/@KleaTech/Advent-of-Code-2020

To try out my code, use:
```
javac Decxx_x.java
java Decxx_x
```

You can use these commands directly in Repl.it
In some cases modifications to these commands are needed.
If so, I'll write the exact commands to the begining of these files.

**Disclaimer:**
*There are some dirty, misleading/misused and poor efficiency code in here.
Don't take this repo too seriously.
All snippets work though.*
